- a complete description in *Report.pdf*
- my complete notebook

To fully appreciate the interactive map of the beautiful Folium library without executing the cells, I strongly advise you to copy paste the [link of the notebook](https://github.com/Proxima-centaury-b/Neighborhood_Clustering/blob/main/Capstone_Oslo_v3.ipynb) into Nbviewer https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
